# Machine Learning as a Service on the XRP Ledger

<hline>
</hline>

## Project Sources and Presentation:

- [**AutoML.NFT Dapp**](https://lucid-mayer-4a70a5.netlify.app/) is running live under github.io.
- [**Documentation**](./doc/Documentation.md) describes the project and the dapp.
- [**YouTube Video**](https://...) is the demo video for the hackathon.


## Executive Summary
  
[AutoML.NFT app](https://github.com/albert-vo-crypto/automlnft) is **a Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) platform** to interactively and dynamically **generate Machine Learning (ML) report** for uploaded data files, and **issue NFT tokens** on the [XRP Ledger](https://xrpl.org/index.html) as certificate of ownership. AutoMLNFT also provides an analytical marketplace, where legal ownership of ML reports can be bought. The project also provides a template for XRPL and other blockchains on how MLaaS dapps with innovative features can be developed on the blockchain.

The app was designed, developed, and implemented during the period of [XRPL NFT Hackathon](https://xrplnft.devpost.com/) by the project team. 

The documentation herein describes the application and presents a blue print of how the system can be developed into the future over an extended time period.

I found out about Vite and I wanted to have a boilerplate for the technologies that I use. You can find more about these in the following links: [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite), [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Eslint](https://eslint.org/), [Prettier](https://prettier.io/).

## Installation

Clone the repo and run `yarn install`

## Start

After the successfull installation of the packages: `yarn dev`
